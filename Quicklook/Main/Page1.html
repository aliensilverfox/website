<h2>Hello I have some ideas for a website</h2>

<p>UserID Example:[AA:000]
Tag: You can add a comment describing a user and others can read
Tap: Gets another users attention
Hush: This is a use to not show other users comments
Hear: Allows you to choose what users to read comments from
Nosey: You can choose to read other users direct interactions

This website is an all chat forum so there aren't any private discusions
if you thought the commands were weird
</p>
